# Used Car Price Prediction Project

![Used Car](used-car.jpg)

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting the prices of used cars. The goal of this project is to build a model that can accurately estimate the price of a car based on various attributes such as make, model, year, mileage, and more. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project aims to assist both buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is located in the `data` directory. It includes a comprehensive collection of used car listings, each with its corresponding attributes and the actual sale price. This dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating the machine learning model.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/used-car-price-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd used-car-price-prediction
   ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies. It is recommended to set up a virtual environment before installing the dependencies. Use a package manager of your choice (e.g., pip or conda) to install the required packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Activate your virtual environment, if you set one up.

2. Open and run the Jupyter notebook `used-car-price-prediction.ipynb`. This notebook contains the code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

3. Customize the analysis as needed. Feel free to experiment with different machine learning algorithms, feature selection techniques, or hyperparameter tuning to improve the price prediction accuracy.

4. Once the model is trained, you can use it to make price predictions for new or unseen car listings.

## Results

Upon executing the notebook, you will obtain the following outcomes:

- Model Training: The notebook will train a machine learning model using the provided dataset, optimizing it to predict used car prices.

- Evaluation Metrics: The notebook includes code to evaluate the performance of the trained model using various metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared.

- Price Prediction: Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the price of a used car based on its attributes.
